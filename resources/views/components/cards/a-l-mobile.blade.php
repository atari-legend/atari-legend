           Did you know Atari Legend is fully responsive and mobile ready?
           You want this site to behave like an app on your phone or tablet?
           Simply open the site in your favorite browser and look for the
           'Add to homescreen' button. In Safari on IOS, first press the
           <a href="{{ asset('images/cards/ios1.jpg') }}">'share' icon</a>,
           then <a href="{{ asset('images/cards/ios2.jpg') }}">the "Add to home screen"</a>
           pop-up appears. In Chrome on Android, you press the
           <a href="{{ asset('images/cards/android1.png') }}">button</a> at the top
           right, and select <a href="{{ asset('images/cards/android2.png') }}">
           'add to homescreen'</a>. Once you have done this, the famous Atari bee
           fits nicely on your homescreen and you can enjoy AL with the tap of a
           finger.
